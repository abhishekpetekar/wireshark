error 1:
Setting up wireshark for non root user

$USER is here to see as a shell variable. 
The third command above adds your user to the wireshark group and should be replaced by sudo adduser <yourUser> wireshark.
Now you should be able to invoke wireshark as yourself (no need to sudo anymore).

How To Apply Wireshark Patch


Problem solved. All I did was to To Install Wireshark 1.12.0 by following the directions in the link below:

http://linuxg.net/how-to-install-wireshark-1-12-0-on-ubuntu-14-04-linux-mint-17-elementary-os-0-3-deepin-2014-and-other-ubuntu-14-04-derivatives/

The new wireshark version is already patched

First of all, i uninstalled the previous wireshark and its dependencies with the autoremove. This "MAY" not be necessary.

How to enable Wireshark without running as root in Trusty 14.04

I found that after the lasted 
sudo apt-get update; 
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and then sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common that a wireshark group been created in /etc/gshadow. 
So I just wrote: gpasswd -a USERNAME wireshark and reboot and now it works fine!
